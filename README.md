# Dead Drop Locker Network - README

This project is a Nostr-native decentralized marketplace and hardware-control dashboard for autonomous smart lockers. It demonstrates how to use NIP-99 for listings, NIP-47 (Nostr Wallet Connect) for Lightning payments, and NIP-17/NIP-04 for encrypted communications between buyers, sellers, and hardware.

What's included:
- React frontend with Leaflet map showing locker nodes
- Owner dashboard to publish and manage lockers (NIP-99 / kind 30402)
- Hooks for Nostr interactions and NWC integration
- ESP32 Arduino template for listening to unlock commands and controlling a solenoid lock
- NIP.md documenting the locker event schema and flows
