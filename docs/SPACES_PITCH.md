## Revenue Model

**100% to You. 0% to DeadDropstr.**

This is pure FOSS. You set your rates, you keep everything.

**Example Numbers:**
- Rate: 1000 sats/hour (~$0.30)
- Average rental: 24 hours
- Your earnings: 24,000 sats (~$7.20) per rental
- 10 rentals/month: 240,000 sats (~$72/month passive)

*No platform fees. No middleman. No hidden costs.*

## Legal/Liability

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Users certify: "No illegal or dangerous items"
- Terms of service clearly posted
- Locker is "mail drop" equivalent (like PO boxes)

**Recommended:** Consult local counsel for specific jurisdiction

## FAQ

**Q: What if someone puts something illegal in it?**  
A: Users must certify contents are legal. You never possess the item—functionally similar to hosting a PO box.

**Q: What if it breaks?**  
A: Remote diagnostics via logs. Replacement parts are cheap ($3-8). We support troubleshooting.

**Q: What about internet outages?**  
A: Locker works offline for valid rentals. New rentals require internet.

**Q: Can I limit what goes in?**  
A: Set size limits in listing. Add custom terms if desired.

**Q: What about abandoned items?**  
A: Auto-expire after rental ends. Owner gets pickup window. After 30 days, local abandoned property laws apply.

**Q: What fees does DeadDropstr take?**  
A: **Zero.** The software is free and open source. You keep 100% of rental revenue. We charge nothing for the protocol, the code, or the network.
