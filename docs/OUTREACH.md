## Template 1: Bitcoin Spaces (PubKey, Bitcoin Commons, etc.)

**Subject:** Deploy Smart Lockers at [Space Name] - Pilot Program

Hi [Name],

I'm building DeadDropstr - an open-source network of Bitcoin-powered dead drop lockers. Think "smart PO boxes" that accept Lightning payments and unlock via NFC.

We're launching a pilot program for 10 Bitcoin spaces worldwide, and [Space Name] would be an ideal first deployment.

**What it is:**
- ~$25 hardware build (ESP32 + NFC + lock)
- Fully autonomous - users rent with Lightning, tap phone to open
- You earn 90% of rental fees (passive income)
- Brings foot traffic to your space

**What you get (free for pilots):**
- Pre-flashed hardware kit
- Listing on our marketplace
- Direct support during setup
- Keep 100% of all revenue

The goal: Enable P2P trade without meetings - hardware wallets, books, swag, etc. Your space becomes a hub for the local circular economy.

I saw [Space Name] at [event/podcast/mention] and think the community would love this. We're selecting pilot spaces now.

Worth a 15-min call to discuss?

P.S. - Fully open source, no proprietary lock-in. Code is on GitHub.

## Template 2: Hackerspaces/Makerspaces

**Subject:** Open Hardware Project - Build a $25 Smart Locker

Hi [Space Name] team,

We're launching an open hardware project that might interest your community: DeadDropstr - Bitcoin-powered smart lockers built on ESP32 and Nostr.

**The build:**
- ESP32-C3 + NFC reader + relay + lock
- ~$25 total cost
- 2-hour build time
- Fully open source

**Why hackerspaces:**
- Perfect workshop project (soldering, IoT, Bitcoin)
- Deploy one at your space, earn sats
- Part of global peer-to-peer network
- Teaching tool for Lightning + Nostr integration

We're offering free hardware kits to 10 pilot spaces willing to:
1. Build it (document for others)
2. Run it for 3 months
3. Provide monthly feedback

Interested in being a pilot? We need makerspaces globally to test different environments.

Full project: https://github.com/PlutarchsEcho/nostr-dead-drop-lockers

Let me know if you'd like to join the pilot program.

## Template 3: Individual Bitcoiners (Twitter/Nostr DMs)

**Subject:** Build a Dead Drop Locker for $25?

Hey [Name],

Building something you might dig: open-source smart lockers powered by Bitcoin/Nostr.

The gist:
- $25 in parts (ESP32 + NFC + lock)
- 2 hour build
- List on marketplace, earn sats
- P2P dead drops without meetings

First 10 builds get free hardware kits + priority support.

Building one to demo at [Space/Event] in [City]. Want to build one too?

P.S. - Starter pack designed for non-experts. You can do this.

## Template 4: Podcast/Newsletter Pitch

**Subject:** Story: Building a $25 Bitcoin-Powered Dead Drop Network

Hi [Host/Editor],

I'm building DeadDropstr - a global network of smart lockers powered by Bitcoin Lightning and Nostr. Think "Airbnb for dead drops" that's fully open source and costs $25 to deploy.

**The angle:**
- Open hardware + circular economy
- Enabling P2P trade without trusted intermediaries
- Global deployment from a starter kit
- Real-world Bitcoin utility beyond speculation

**Why now:**
- First pilot deployments launching
- Growing need for privacy-preserving exchange
- Hardware is cheap, Bitcoin is ready

I think [Show/Publication] audience would find this interesting. Happy to:
- Demo the working prototype
- Share build process
- Discuss the vision

Available for interview [dates].

## Template 7: Build Documentation Request

**Subject:** Documenting Your DeadDropstr Build

Hi [Builder Name],

Stoked you're building a DeadDropstr locker! 

We're collecting build documentation to help others. Could you:
1. Take photos during your build (3-5 key steps)
2. Note any gotchas or tips
3. Share final photos of the deployed locker
4. Brief testimonial: "Why I built this"

We'll feature you on:
- GitHub repo
- Website builder gallery
- Twitter/Nostr threads
